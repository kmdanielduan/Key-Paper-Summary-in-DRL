# Key Paper Summary in DRL

This repository contains the summaries of around 100 key papers on deep reinforcement learning listed in on OpenAI Spinning Up. It aims to provide the readers with a quick preview of the major algorithms used in DRL and a starting point of getting into this field.

### 01. Model-Free RL

[001] Playing Atari with Deep Reinforcement Learning, Mnih et al, 2013. **Algorithm: DQN.** Links: [[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/1312.5602v1)] [[summary](https://github.com/kmdanielduan/Key-Paper-Summary-in-DRL/blob/master/01.%20Model-Free%20RL/%5B001%5D%20Playing%20Atari%20with%20Deep%20Reinforcement%20Learning.md)]

### 13. Classic Papers in RL or Review

[100] Policy Gradient Methods for Reinforcement Learning with Function Approximation, Sutton et al, 2000. **Contributions:** Established policy gradient theorem and showed convergence of policy gradient algorithm for arbitrary policy classes.
